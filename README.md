With this application, an editorial team can generate quizzes flexibly:

● A quiz can contain any number of questions
● A quiz question can have any number of correct or incorrect answers
● A quiz question has rules, for example
○ “choose the correct answer”
○ “which two answers are correct”
○ the time the participant has for an answer
■ for example 1min
● A quiz has a start and end date after which the ranking can be drawn up
● The quiz
○ runs equally well on PC, Mac, Android and iOS devices
○ in the Google Cloud
○ is fast due to modern technology (SPA Vue)
○ works directly from the Internet
■ via the url https://speelmee.app and therefore
■ no play/app store downloads!

○ The participant
■ only needs to choose a pseudonym to participate in the quiz
■ can also install the app on other devices if desired
■ can immediately delete his/her data from the database if desired
■ can always return to the app if he/she leaves the app to visit multiple internet pages
○ The app keeps track of where the participant stopped answering questions and
can ask the next question. ● Integrability in partner publication
○ Technically a piece of cake: include the url https://speelmee.app in the
publication
○ The content framework is up to the publishing partner
○ Visual appearance can easily be adjusted and, if desired,
match the branding of the partner publication

Quiz scenario in the demo
● five multiple-choice questions every week
● answer time 1 min
● award ceremony every 4 weeks
● a short correct message per question
● the participant can choose
○ go directly to the ranking
○ to read a long explanation per question

Content development
To see what is involved in the production of questions, we have experimented
with about thirty quiz questions.
