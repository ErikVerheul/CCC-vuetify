<h2>With this application, an editorial team can generate quizzes flexibly:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A quiz can contain any number of questions</li>
  <li>A quiz question can have any number of correct or incorrect answers</li>
  <li>A quiz question has rules, for example
    <ul>
      <li>“choose the correct answer”</li>
      <li>“which two answers are correct”</li>
      <li>the time the participant has for an answer
        <ul>
          <li>for example 1min</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A quiz has a start and end date after which the ranking can be drawn up</li>
  <li>The quiz
    <ul>
      <li>runs equally well on PC, Mac, Android and iOS devices</li>
      <li>in the Google Cloud</li>
      <li>is fast due to modern technology (SPA Vue)</li>
      <li>works directly from the Internet
        <ul>
          <li>via the url https://speelmee.app and therefore</li>
          <li>no play/app store downloads!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
  <li>The participant
    <ul>
      <li>only needs to choose a pseudonym to participate in the quiz</li>
      <li>can also install the app on other devices if desired</li>
      <li>can immediately delete his/her data from the database if desired</li>
      <li>can always return to the app if he/she leaves the app to visit multiple internet pages
        <ul>
          <li>The app keeps track of where the participant stopped answering questions and can ask the next question</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Integrability in partner publication
    <ul>
      <li>Technically a piece of cake: include the url https://speelmee.app in the publication</li>
      <li>The content framework is up to the publishing partner</li>
      <li>Visual appearance can easily be adjusted and, if desired match the branding of the partner publication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Quiz scenario in the demo
    <ul>
      <li>five multiple-choice questions every week</li>
      <li>answer time 1 min</li>
      <li>award ceremony every 4 weeks</li>
      <li>a short correct message per question</li>
      <li>the participant can choose
        <ul>
          <li>go directly to the ranking</li>
          <li>to read a long explanation per question</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Content development</h4>
<p>To see what is involved in the production of questions, we have experimented with about thirty quiz questions.</p>
